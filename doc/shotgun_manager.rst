Basic Usage
-----------

Once Shotgun Manager has been installed and enabled there is a new tab in the properties panel in the 3D View.
At first it should only have one button called `Enable Shotgun`, if you press it Shotgun will installed and enabled.

After that there should be some info about the currently installed version. Below the version info there are two buttons,
one label `Check For Updates` and another labeled `Disable Shotgun`.

Pressing `Disable Shotgun` will disable the keymap. `Check For Updates` will check to see if there is a newer version
that can be downloaded, if there is you can install it by pressing `Update To vX.Y.Z` where `vX.Y.Z` is whatever the
newest version is.

If you wan't to hide the panel in the 3D Viewport go to the addon settings (Ctrl-Alt-U to open User Preferences and
under the addon tab search for "Shotgun Manager") make sure that `Show UI Panel` is unchecked. Then press `Save User Preferences`.
You can still enable/disable and update the keymap from the addon settings.

By default, Shotgun Manager will enable left-click selection, you can change this behavior in the addon settings by unchecking `Left Mouse Selection`.
