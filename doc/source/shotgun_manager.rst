Shotgun Manager is a lightweight addon that makes it easier to install and update the Shotgun keymap.
For instructions on how to install it see the :ref:`installation <install_shotgun_manager>` page.

Basic Usage
-----------

Once Shotgun Manager has been installed and enabled there is a new tab in the properties panel in the 3D View.
At first it should only have one button called `Enable Shotgun`, if you press that it will install and enable Shotgun.

After that there should be some info of the currently installed keymap. Below the version info there are two buttons,
one label `Check For Updates` and another labeled `Disable Shotgun`.

Pressing `Disable Shotgun` will disable the keymap. `Check For Updates` will check to see if there is a newer version
that can be downloaded, if there is you can install it by pressing `Update To vX.Y.Z` where `vX.Y.Z` is whatever the
newest version is.

If you wan't to hide the panel in the 3D Viewport go to the addon settings (Ctrl-Alt-U to open User Preferences and
under the addon tab search for "Shotgun Manager") make sure that `Show UI Panel` is unchecked. Then press `Save User Preferences`.
You can still enable/disable and update the keymap from the addon settings.
