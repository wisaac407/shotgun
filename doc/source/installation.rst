There are two way to install Shotgun the first is by using the Shotgun Manager addon and the second is to install it manually.

-----------------------------
Shotgun Manager (Recommended)
-----------------------------

You can install the Shotgun Manager addon just like any other addon. Go to the `latest release <https://github.com/wisaac407/shotgun/releases/latest>`_
and download the file called `shotgun_manager.zip`. Then in Blender, open the user preferences (`Ctrl-Alt-U`) and under
the add-ons tab click `Install From File...` then select the file you just downloaded. Finally, don't forget to enable it
and press `Save User Preferences` so it is enabled by default.

Go to the `addon docs <shotgun_manager.html>`_ to learn how to use the addon, or head over to the `overview <overview.html>`_
to see how to use the keymap.
