Installation
============

You can install the Shotgun Manager addon just like any other addon. First, make sure you've downloaded a copy from the Blender Market.
Then in Blender, open the user preferences (`Ctrl-Alt-U`) and under
the add-ons tab click `Install From File...` then select the file you just downloaded. Finally, don't forget to enable it
and press `Save User Preferences` so it is enabled by default.

Go to the :ref:`shotgun_manager` docs to learn how to use the addon, or head over to the :ref:`overview <overview>`
to see how to use the keymap.
