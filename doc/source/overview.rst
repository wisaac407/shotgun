Overview
========

Here is a birds eye view of the basics of Shotgun. Because Shotgun is designed to augment Blender's existing keymap most
of the hotkeys will be the same as what you're already used to. For a more detailed reference of every hotkey see the
`list of all keymaps <keymaps.html>`_.

----------
Navigation
----------

All navigation in Shotgun is done with the mouse. Orbiting is done with the middle mouse, panning is the action mouse
(right mouse if using a standard installation) and zooming the scroll wheel.

-----------
Interaction
-----------

There are a few basic hotkeys that are standardized across areas:

 - `Ctrl-A`: is select all/toggle select
 - `Double Click`: select group (what determines a group depends on the specific area)
 - `Alt-Left Mouse`: border select (shift to extend)
 - `Alt-Right Mouse`: lasso select (shift to deselect)
 - `Alt-Right Click`: move cursor (in the dope sheet and graph editor it changes the current frame)
 - `Ctrl-Alt-Click`: Add new point (e.g. extrude vertex)

.. note:: When UV editing border select is `Ctrl-Alt-Left Mouse`
