Shotgun Manager (Recommended)
-----------------------------

You can install the Shotgun Manager addon just like any other addon. Go to the `latest release <https://github.com/wisaac407/shotgun/releases/latest>`_
and download the file called `shotgun_manager.zip`. Then in Blender, open the user preferences (`Ctrl-Alt-U`) and under
the add-ons tab click `Install From File...` then select the file you just downloaded. Finally, don't forget to enable it
and press `Save User Preferences` so it is enabled by default.

Go to the :ref:`shotgun_manager` docs to learn how to use the addon, or head over to the :ref:`overview <overview>`
to see how to use the keymap.

Manual Installation
-------------------

For the manual installation go to the `latest release <https://github.com/wisaac407/shotgun/releases/latest>`_ and download the file called `shotgun.py`.
In Blender, open the user preferences (`Ctrl-Alt-U`) and under the input tab click `Import Key Configuration...` then select the file you just downloaded.
Shotgun is designed to work with **left-click selection**, so make sure to change that in the input tab of the User Preferences.

If you wan't Shotgun to be the default key configuration when you reopen Blender be sure to press `Save User Preferences`.
